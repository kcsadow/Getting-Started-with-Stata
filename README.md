This was designed as an expedited summer Stata Coding Class for undergraduate RA's interested in improving their Stata skills. 

I initially designed designed the course to last 10 weeks with 30-minutes sessions covering topics specifically requested by my RAs.  

I created all lessons and pulled examples from publicly-available education and labor-related data from the Census and the New York City Department of Education.   

A few of the overarching goals of the course were to teach students to consider: 
1. There are multiple ways to answer a single problem BUT different techniques do not always have the same outcome. It's important to always check our methods to ensure we are getting the expected answer. 
2. There are a ton of publicly available data sources with varying levels of quality. When using a new dataset, question the accuracy of the data. Determine who the data represents and how reporting might affect generalizability.
3. Coding can be frustrating! It is an iterative process and there are tons of resources that can help us to piece together the correct answer.
